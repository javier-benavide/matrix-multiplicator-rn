and use Android as target OS (use Typescript).

2. Clone the git repository with `git clone https://github.com/javier-benavide/mobile-excersise-matrix-multiplicator`

3. Install the dependencies with "yarn install" in the cloned repo

## Exercise

For the real-time exercise you need to build a mobile App with React Native and Typescript that
